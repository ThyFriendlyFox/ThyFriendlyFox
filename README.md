## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate AI Enthusiast, SAP Software Developer, and Engineer. With a proven experience in producing codes for various businesses across different sectors, I aim to utilize technology as a tool to solve complex problems and make lives easier. 

I've also contributed significantly to the academic realm, with several papers under my belt presented in American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). My work in these papers revolve around the innovative scripts I've developed.

My preferred language for coding is Javascript, although I'm adept at learning and implementing various other languages as per project requirements.
